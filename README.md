This code is for both ESP32 and ESP8266.

It allows you to set up (Wi-Fi manager config) parameters vie old style MENU UI using the serial port.

It works best when you are using Putty to comunicate with your "Arduino", will function with the Serial Monitor (in Arduino IDE). 

Or use a browser based serial terminal like https://robocallz.com/TTY/ but this needs a browser with serial communication support.
